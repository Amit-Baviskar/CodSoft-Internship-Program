> ## **1. Movie Rating Prediction with Python**


* **Project Overview:**

In this project, I built a system to predict movie ratings based on multiple features. The process involved collecting and preparing data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, and applying machine learning models to predict ratings.

 * **Key Features:**

Applied data cleaning and preprocessing methods.
Conducted EDA using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to discover trends.
Built machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Random Forest to predict movie ratings.
Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

* **Skills Gained:**

Practical experience with data cleaning and preprocessing.
Deepened understanding of regression algorithms and their practical use cases.
Enhanced proficiency in Python libraries like Scikit-learn for machine learning.
